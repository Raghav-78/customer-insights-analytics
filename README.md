# customer-insights-analytics-SQL
This project and the data used was part of a case study which can be found [here](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-1/). It focuses on examining patterns, trends, and factors influencing customer spending in order to gain insights into their preferences, purchasing habits, and potential areas for improvement in menu offerings or marketing strategies in a dining establishment.


### Problem Statement

person wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favorite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalized experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

person has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues - but he hopes that these examples are enough for you to write fully functioning SQL queries to help him answer his questions!
